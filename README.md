## User story :speech_balloon:
> - I want an application that will search and display a list of recipes based on a search term that I provide.
> - As a user who also enjoys dining out, the application should also return a list of local restaurants that relate to my recipe search term. I, the user, will provide a zip code to determine locality.

## Features
- As a user I want this website to have ‘clean’ and ‘simple’ front-end style.
- As a user, the application must be ‘responsive’.  It should look great when viewed from any device.
- As a user, I want the application to remember my last search if I refresh the page
- As a user, if my search term returns limited restaurant results (<5), I want the application to supplement those results with a search of my zip code only.
